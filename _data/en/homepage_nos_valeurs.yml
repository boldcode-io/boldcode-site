      While our clients are major INGOs and Intergovernmental Organizations, we
      are committed to provide IT and cybersecurity services to smaller NGOs.

      We also help smaller start ups with affordable IT solutions that can help
      them kickstart their dream project.

      Clientâ€™s security is of utmost importance to us. We provide regular
      security audits and fixes to our regular clients.

      We work with civil society, think-tanks and governments to promote
      transparency and democracy through technology.

      We believe in a global network of talents and are committed to create
      better IT jobs in developing countries.

      We are committed to maximize our social and environmental impact.
